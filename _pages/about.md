I am currently pursuing a D.Phil. in Statistics from the University of Oxford, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Arnaud Doucet, Prof. Yee Whye Teh, Prof. George Deligiannidis, and Dr. Tom Rainforth.
I am being funded through the Clarendon Fund Scholarship.

Before starting my D.Phil., I was an Applied Scientist II at Amazon Web Services, Inc. in Pasadena, California.
I previously completed my undergraduate studies from the University of Texas at Austin, earning a B.Sc. in Computer Science with Honros (Turing Scholars Honors) and a B.Sc. in Mathematics.
