I am currently pursuing a D.Phil. in Statistics from the University of Oxford.
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Arnaud Doucet, Prof. Yee Whye Teh, Prof. George Deligiannidis, and Dr. Tom Rainforth.
I am being funded through the Clarendon Fund Scholarship.

From 2018-21, I was an Applied Scientist II at AWS AI in Pasadena, California.
From 2014-18, I did my B.Sc. in Computer Science with Honors (Turing Scholars Honors) and B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin, with Prof. Adam Klivans as my thesis advisor.
