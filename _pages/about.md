I am currently pursuing a D.Phil. in Statistics from the University of Oxford, UK.
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Arnaud Doucet, Prof. Yee Whye Teh, Prof. George Deligiannidis, and Dr. Tom Rainforth.
I am a recipient of the Clarendon Fund Scholarship, Univ. of Oxford.

From 2018-21, I worked as an Applied Scientist II at AWS AI in Pasadena, CA, USA.
From 2014-18, I did my B.Sc. in Computer Science with Honors (Turing Scholars Honors) and B.Sc. in Mathematics with Honors from the University of Texas at Austin, TX, USA, with Prof. Adam Klivans as my thesis advisor.
